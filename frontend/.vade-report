Implemented Vercel Web Analytics integration for the Cognify frontend project.

## Summary
Successfully integrated Vercel Web Analytics into the React + Vite frontend application, enabling real-time visitor tracking and analytics insights alongside the existing Vercel Speed Insights.

## Changes Made

### Modified Files:
1. **frontend/package.json**
   - Added `@vercel/analytics` v1.6.1 to dependencies
   - No other changes to project configuration

2. **frontend/src/App.tsx**
   - Added import: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/react";`
   - Added `<Analytics />` component to the render function, positioned after `<SpeedInsights />`
   - Maintains compatibility with existing BrowserRouter, route configuration, and other components

3. **frontend/package-lock.json**
   - Updated lock file to reflect new dependencies (226 packages added as transitive dependencies)

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows the Vercel Web Analytics setup guide for React applications:
- Used the `@vercel/analytics/react` export which provides the `Analytics` component
- The component is placed at the root of the app (within the main React component) to track all routes
- Works seamlessly with react-router-dom for automatic route tracking
- Component is rendered at the end of the JSX tree, after other Vercel integrations (SpeedInsights)

## Integration Points

The Analytics component is positioned strategically:
```tsx
<>
  <BrowserRouter>
    {/* Routes */}
  </BrowserRouter>
  <SpeedInsights />
  <Analytics />  {/* New addition */}
</>
```

## Next Steps for User

After deployment to Vercel:
1. Enable Web Analytics in the Vercel dashboard (Analytics tab → Enable)
2. Deploy the updated app to Vercel
3. The app will start tracking visitors automatically
4. View analytics data in the Vercel dashboard under the Analytics tab

## Pre-Existing Issues

The project has some pre-existing build and linting issues unrelated to this change:
- TypeScript configuration issues in react-router integration
- Type mismatches in Quiz component
- React Hook dependency warnings

These issues existed before the Analytics implementation and do not affect the Analytics integration.

## Verification

- Package installation successful (npm install @vercel/analytics)
- Import statement verified and working
- No new linting errors introduced by the Analytics component addition
- Changes follow existing code patterns and conventions in the project
